We do what is necessary to facilitate the exercise of your rights by implementing Accessible and fast communication channels. We answer your requests within the deadlines in force.

**Our compliance ecosystem protects your data**

We make our partners and service providers aware of the regulatory requirements in order to guarantee the overall protection of personal data entrusted to them. A compliance charter is submitted to subcontractors and contractual clauses incorporating data protection is adopted.

MOBIOOS does not transfer personal data to a third country or to another international organization outside the EU.

**Notify in case of data breach**

In the event of a violation of personal data, MOBIOOS undertakes to notify the competent supervisory authority (CNIL) no later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it in accordance with Article 33 of EU Regulation 2016/679.

When a violation of personal data is likely to create a high risk to a person's rights and freedoms, MOBIOOS undertakes to inform the data subject of the violation as soon as possible, in accordance with Article 34 of EU Regulation 2016/679.

**We have defined the retention duration**

Your data is collected to serve only for the purposes expressed in the service contracts you have signed. We systematically delete your information as soon as it is no longer needed, in particular when closing the user account.
